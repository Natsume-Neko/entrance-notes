## Regular Expressions
### Definition
A regular expression is a formal notation used to describe regular languages. Regular expressions consist of symbols, operators like union (+), concatenation, and Kleene Closure (\*), which allow repetition of symbols. They can represent languages accepted by finite automata (DFA and NFA) and are useful in simplifying the design of automata.
### Equivalence of Regular Expressions and Finite Automata
- Every language defined by one of these automata is also defined by a regular expression.
- Every language defined by a regular expression is defined by one of these automata.
### Convert DFA's to Regular Expression
- State Eliminating
