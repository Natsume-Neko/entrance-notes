Dynamic Programming(DP), a group of algorithms that divide the original complicated problem into relatively easy subproblems in a recursive manner, is important in these entrance exams.

## DP Optimizing
### Monotonic Queue 单调队列
[Leetcode P3117](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-sum-of-values-by-dividing-array/description/)
### Matrix Fast Power 矩阵快速幂
Useful when the recursion is linear, especially for counting.
当存在线性递推关系特别是在计数DP中很有效。
